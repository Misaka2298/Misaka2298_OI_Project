8 This happened because you didnt play Genshin Impact
168 The ultimate meaning of life the origin and end of the universe philosophy and science are tormenting the human mind Only by playing with the Genshin Impact can people get rid of such boring troubles and obtain real peace If someone wants to praise this work with the best game I can only deeply regret it because this persons understanding of it is less than one in ten thousand which is why they make such superficial judgments attempting to describe its greatness in words But if they are really favored by it they should all praise the embodiment of this miracle the greatest work in human history slanders Genshin Impact when they are ignorant understands Genshin Impact when they are sensible and becomes friends when they are mature The more you understand Genshin Impact the more you will use it as a beacon to guide lost ships on the endless sea at night a wind blowing in the hot summer and a bonfire burning in the cold winter
